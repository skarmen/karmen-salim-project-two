## Multi-page client design PSD Conversion
The goal of this project was to convert a provided PSD design into a functional, responsive website. The design/UX decisions for tablet/mobile views were made without provided PSD designs by the client. 

The website was built using only HTML & CSS. The layout of the web pages was built with Flexbox.
